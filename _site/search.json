    "section": "",
    "text": "When learning a programming language, applying the new concepts regularly is absolutely essential. Without regular practice it is hard to impossible to remember everything you need to actually enjoy working with R.\nTherefore, I prepared a small set of exercises for each session that I recommend you to do after the session. This will help you to remember what you have learned and to find out what you did not understand well. I then urge you to post your problems on Moodle, to ask your colleagues and to help each other out. This will be a great boost to your learning progress: explaining something to others is not only great in a normative sense, it also helps you to get a deeper understanding of the concepts yourself.\nIn this short post I quickly explain how you can use the exercises that I have prepared for you. For those of you interested in the underlying mechanics: all exercises were prepared using the package learnr together with the gradethis package, and are distributed in the package DataScienceExercises.\nTo use the exercises you must have installed the packages learnr, gradethis and DataScienceExercises. If you followed the instructions in the tutorial on installing R packages this should be the case. If for some reasons you need to install them, you can do this via:\n\n\nShow R code\npack_names &lt;- c(\n  \"rstudio/learnr\",\n  \"rstudio/gradethis\",\n  \"graebnerc/DataScienceExercises\"\n)\nremotes::install_github(\n  repo = pack_names, upgrade = \"always\")\n\n\nNote that this requires a previous installation of the package remotes:\n\n\nShow R code\ninstall.packages(\"remotes\")\n\n\nSince I update the exercises according to your feedback, and add new exercises over the semester, I strongly recommend you to update the package DataScienceExercises each time before you start practicing. To do so you need an internet connection. If you just want to do the exercises without updating the package, an internet connection is not required: the exercises themselves also work offline.\nTo update the package, simply type the following into the console and press Enter:\n\n\nShow R code\nremotes::install_github(\n  repo = \"graebnerc/DataScienceExercises\", upgrade = \"always\")\n\n\nThis should update your package version to the most recent release.\nIf you want to start an exercise you first need to figure out the name of the exercise sheet. This is provided in the Material section of the course webpage. Then you call execute the following code via the console in R Studio, replacing ‚ÄòEX_NAME‚Äô with the name of the exercise sheet:\n\n\nShow R code\nlearnr::run_tutorial(\n  name = \"EX_NAME\", \n  package = \"DataScienceExercises\", \n  shiny_args=list(\"launch.browser\"=TRUE))\n\n\nThe first exercise sheet, for instance, is called Basics. Thus, to call it execute the following:\n\n\nShow R code\nlearnr::run_tutorial(\n  name = \"Basics\", \n  package = \"DataScienceExercises\", \n  shiny_args=list(\"launch.browser\"=TRUE))\n\n\nLastly, if you encounter a bug or a mistake, or have an idea for a good exercise, please let me know via the issue tracker of the DataScienceExercises package or via Moodle. Thank you!"

    "text": "After installing R and R-Studio, you still need to install a number of so called R packages. We will learn more about what packages are and how to use them later. Nevertheless, I strongly recommend you to install already all the packages you will need over the following semester already now. This way you make sure that everything is working now, and you save yourself from trouble during the semester. Moreover, installing these packages is necessary to do the exercises provided after each session.\nTo install packages, a stable internet connection is required. Then, proceed as follows:\n\nDownload the script install_packages_script.R and save it in a directory of your choice\nOpen the file install_packages_script.R in R-Studio. To this end, right-click on the file and select Open with, and then choose R-Studio.\nAdjust the first line of the script to the OS you are using. For instance, when you are using a Mac the file should look like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect lines 1-52 and click on the button Run (the screenshot only shows the lines 42-52, the previous lines are also selected):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck if the package here was installed. You will get the respective message in the console:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you encounter any problems, please make a screenshot and post it in the Moodle forum.\n\nSelect the rest of the scrip and run it as you did with the first lines. If you get the following message everything worked well and all packages were installed successfully:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf not, please post the file InstallationLog.txt and a screenshot with an error into the Moodle forum.\nNote: maybe you will see the following message during the installation process (possible multiple times):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI recommend to type No and press enter. If, for any reason, the installation process is not successful you might run the installation commands again and try responding with Yes, this might sometimes fix the problem."

At first sight this is more intuitive and respects the sequence of events: first, the result of 2 + 3 gets created, i.e.¬†a new object gets defined. Then, this object gets the name intermediate_result. However, the code that results from such practice is usually much more difficult to read, so it is common practice to use &lt;- rather than -&gt;.‚Ü©Ô∏é\nWickham and Bryan (2022) provide an excellent introduction to the development of R packages‚Ü©Ô∏é\nPackages not released on this platform can also be installed directly from the repository they were published, e.g.¬†Github. To this end, the package remotes must be installed first, then you can use functions such as install_github(). A short manual is provided here.‚Ü©Ô∏é"

To this end, this document is meant to provide you with all the information needed. If you have questions, please use the Moodle forum. It is very unlikely that you are the only person having a particular problem. Maybe others can already help you out, and if not, all should benefit from the solution we find for your problem together.\nPlease also note that there is a separate tutorial on how to install the packages (a.k.a. R extensions) that we are going to use over the semester. Its best to continue with this tutorial on installing the required R packages directly after you have complete this one."

    "section": "Install R",
    "text": "Install R\nThe installation of R is very similar across operating systems (OS). The easiest way is to visit the R Homepage and to download the most recent version for your OS. In case you are using Mac OS and want to use Homebrew, its best to use this formula.\nImportant for Mac user: There are different versions of R for Intel chips, and Apple chips (M1, M2, etc.). It is very important that you install the correct version. If you are not sure whether your Mac contains a chip from Intel or Apple, click on the Apple symbol in the upper left of the screen, then click on About this Mac and you can see which processor your Mac is using in the new window. If you have an Apple chip, always install R for the so called arm64 architecture. Intel chip users must use the x86_64 architecture instead.\n\nOnly Windows: Install RTools\nIf you are using Windows, it is necessary to install RTools, which is required if you want to use packages written by others that are not officially released. To do so, simply visit the following website, download the installer, and install the software:\nWhen asked during the installation process, do not select the box for Add rtools to system PATH, but do select the box for Save version information to registry.\n\n\nOnly Mac: Command Line Developer Tools\nThe Command Line Developer Tools could be thought of as the Mac pendant to RTools. These allow you to build R packages from source (meaning, basically, you can use packages that are in early stages of distribution, or packages that are not released on the official R servers).\nThe easiest way to install them is to open the App Terminal, and then to type\nxcode-select --install\nand press Enter. Then a pop up window will open and allow you to install the software."

    "section": "Update R",
    "text": "Update R\nIn case R is already installed on your computer you should make sure that your version is more of less up to date. For our seminar you should use at least R version R 4.4.2. The version you are currently using is shown as soon as you start R.\nPlease note: if you installed R anew in the previous step, you do not need to update it. The information on updating R is mainly relevant for people who have installed R already some time ago.\n\nMacOS users\nFor MacOS users, the easiest route to update R is to just re-install the most current version from the R Homepage. Keep in mind that in this case you might need to re-install all previously installed packages. If you have a lot of packages installed that you want to keep, the following steps facilitates the re-installation process. First, save a list with all the packages you installed yourself. To this end type the following into the R console:1\npackage_overview &lt;- installed.packages()\npackage_names &lt;- as.vector(\n  package_overview[is.na(package_overview[,\"Priority\"]), 1])\nsave(package_names, file=\"r_packages.rda\")\nAfter re-installing R, you then need to load the file you previously saved and identify the missing packages. You can use the following code to do so if you are in the working directory in which you saved the file \"r_packages.rda\":\nload(\"r_packages.rda\")\npackages_new &lt;- installed.packages()\npackages_new_ &lt;- as.vector(packages_new[is.na(packages_new[,\"Priority\"]), 1])\nmissing_packages &lt;- setdiff(package_names, packages_new_)\ninstall.packages(missing_packages)\nupdate.packages()\n\n\nWindows users\nWindows users have a slightly more convenient route available to them: the installr package. It does not require you to re-install your packages. Just type the following code into your R console:2\ninstall.packages(\"installr\")\nlibrary(installr)\nupdateR(TRUE)\nFor more information see the package website.\n\n\nLinux users\nLinux users simply install R via their package manager. A quick search on Google should provide you with the information that are relevant for your particular Linux distribution. Updating is usually straightforward as well: just run the respective command from your package manager."

So, after installing R got to the R-Studio download page and download the RStudio Desktop version for your OS according to the installation instructions provided.\nIf you are on Mac and you are using Homebrew you may use this formula.\nIf you want to update R-Studio, you just install it again. Please note that the minimal version for this seminar should be RStudio 2023.12.1+402, which is from late January 2024. You can check your version by clicking on RStudio in the upper left part of your screen when R-Studio is open. Then click on About RStudio."

If not, you will be asked to install the respective software packages (see above).\n\n\nWindows\nOn Windows you download Git for Windows from the official Webpage, which also provides you with all the relevant instructions.\n\n\nLinux\nOn Linux use you package manager. In most cases the name of the relevant package is git-all, so on Ubuntu, for instance, you would install Git via sudo apt install git-all."
