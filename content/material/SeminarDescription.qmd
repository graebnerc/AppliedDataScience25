# Overall Goal of the Course

You will master practical data science skills using the open source programming language R. You will learn to collect, analyze, and visualize data to support managerial decision-making. Moreover, you will develop competencies in statistical modeling, machine learning, and reproducible reporting that are essential for evidence-based management practices.

# Learning Goals

More concretely, this seminar aims to teach the following competencies:

**Technical Expertise:**

- Program effectively in R for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization
- Create professional reports and presentations using Quarto for reproducible research
- Apply statistical methods and machine learning techniques to business datasets
- Import, clean, and prepare real-world business data for analysis
- Develop predictive models for business forecasting and decision support

**Methodological Competence:**

- Design and conduct data-driven analyses to answer business questions
- Select appropriate statistical methods and visualization techniques for different types of business problems
- Interpret and communicate analytical results to non-technical stakeholders
- Evaluate the quality and limitations of data and analytical approaches

**Social and Personal Skills:**

- Work collaboratively on data science projects
- Present complex analytical findings clearly and transparently
- Critically evaluate data-driven claims and recommendations in business contexts

# Course Information
