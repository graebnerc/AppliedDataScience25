## ðŸ“š General references


The following textbooks offer a good general reference to the course
content, and I think its a good idea to read into these books in a 
general way. Moreover, I often point to chapters in the respective 
session pages.

- Wickham, H., Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel, M., & Grolemund, G. (2023). *R for data science: Import, tidy, transform, visualize, and model data* (2nd edition). O'Reilly. [https://r4ds.hadley.nz/](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/)

For more advanced details on the fundamentals of programming in R, I 
recommend the following:

- Wickham, H. (2019). *Advanced R* (Second edition). CRC Press/Taylor & Francis Group. [https://adv-r.hadley.nz/](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/)

For the model-related parts of the lecture I recommend the following book as a further reading reference:
